### Hi there 👋🙂 I'm Paola Rios,

I am a sanitary engineer graduated from the University of Antioquia, but for some time I have been studying programming, because I like technology and I want to become a software developer 👩‍💻, I find many job and learning possibilities in this area, I like learning constantly  and in programming there is a lot to learn and this motivates me.

- ⚡ My motivational phrase: “You're never given a dream without also being given the power to make it true.” ― Richard Bach.
- 🚵 my hobbies: traveling, biking, hiking, listening to music, going to the cinema and so on.
- 
- 🔭 I’m currently studying programming in MisionTIC 🚀, It is a program of the Colombian government to train new programmers and face the challenges of the fourth industrial               revolution.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java, MySQL, JavaScript, Html, Css among other issues related to frontend development.
- ✨ I’m very interested in frontend development and I want to focus on this.
- 💻 I like self-taught learning, I have taken several online courses on platforms such as Platzi and YouTube.
- 💡 Here in github I have some notes of the courses that I have done and I hope to continue registering new interesting projects.

Bye! 😀
